    "The vast majority of people do not learn well by sitting and listening to someone talk, or simply reading something, or watching someone do something. While listening, reading, and watching can be useful as first steps, they rarely lead to even minimal competence. That is true of most skills, but it is especially true of computer programming. Being a programmer means knowing how to define a task to be accomplished in a way that is clear and precise, knowing how to break that task down into a set of tiny steps, and knowing how to tell a computer to perform each of those tiny steps. This sort of thinking does not come naturally to most people, and acquiring it can only be done by doing it. Trying to learn programming by reading a set of notes, or watching someone lecture, is about as useful as trying to learn carpentry by watching reruns of This Old House. It's just not going to happen. Thus the most important thing you can do, in this workshop and beyond, is practice writing programs over and over again until you get good at it."

    "There's a subtle but important point to notice here, which is the meaning of the equal sign. In mathematics, the statement that a = b is a statement that two things are equal, and it can be either true or false. In python, as in almost all other programming languages, a = b means something different. It means that the value of the variable a should be changed to whatever value b has. Thus the statement we made a = a + 1 is not an assertion (which is obviously false) that a is equal to itself plus one. It is an instruction to the computer to take the variable a, and 1 to it, and then store the result back into the variable a. In this example, it therefore changes the value of a from 4 to 5.\n",

The second statement has the opposite effect: the computer forgets what is stored in b, and replaces it by whatever is stored in a.\n",

    "A floating point variable is capable of holding real numbers. Why have different types of variables for integers versus non-integer real numbers? In mathematics there is no need to make the distinction, of course: all integers are real numbers, so it would seem that there should be no reason to have a separate type of variable to hold integers. However, this ignores the way computers work. On a computer, operations involving integers are exact: 1 + 1 is exactly 2. However, operations on real numbers are necessarily inexact. I say necessarily because a real number is capable of having an arbitrary number of decimal places. The number pi contains infinitely many digits, and never repeats, but my computer only comes with a finite amount of memory and processor power. Even rational numbers run into this problem, because their decimal representation (or to be exact their representation in binary) may be an infinitely repeating sequence. Thus it is not possible to perform operations on arbitrary real numbers to exact precision. Instead, arithmetic operations on floating point numbers are approximate, with the level of accuracy determined by factors like how much memory one wants to devote to storing digits, and how much processor time one wants to spend manipulating them. On most computers a python floating point number is accurate to about 1 in 10^15, but this depends on both the architecture and on the operations you perform. That's enough accuracy for many purposes, but there are plenty of situations (for example counting things) when we really want to do things precisely, and we want 1 + 1 to be exactly 2. That's what integers are there for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: as a fun exercise, once you've learned about loops, try setting a variable to 0.5, then setting it equal to its own square root N times, and then setting equal to its own square N times. Then see what the value of the variable turns out to be. Of course the right answer is that it should be exactly 0.5. See how well this works depending on the number of operations N you perform.\n",

    "The first command uses the *np.arange()* command to create an array that starts at 0 and goes up to 2 pi in steps of 0.01, and the second command plots x versus sin(x). Note that numpy pre-defines the number *np.pi* for you, and also knows the basic trig functions such as *np.sin()*, as well as many other functions as well. The format of the plot command is that you specify two arrays, one that gives the x coordinates of the points, and a second giving the y coordinates. Hopefully you see a window on your screen that looks like the one above."

    "The final way to interact with python is to write a python program, and that is the last topic for this class. The point of writing a program is to put down commands once and for all, so that they don't have to be typed manually every time. For example, let's say that we want to make a plot of a sin function and we don't want to have to type in the commands every time. We can put those commands into a file and then execute it. To do this, we need to use a text editor to create a file to hold the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file we are going to create is a text file. Files come in many different formats, but one of the most important, and the one used for all computer program source, is a text file. A text file is one where the contents consist of a series of characters, with no metadata describing formatting (for example no underlines, boldface, font information, etc.). The most restrictive type of text file contains only a limited set of characters, representing the letters of the English language, the Arabic numerals, some punctuation symbols, and a limited set of control characters (for example a character representing a line break); files in this format are called ASCII text files. Computer programs are written using this set of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs for editing text files are called text editors. One can also edit text files using word processors like Microsoft Word, but these tend to be incredibly cumbersome for this purpose, since they have a ton of functionality that we're not going to use, and by default they save files in much more complicated formats that make use of that functionality. Even supposedly lightweight editors like Mac's TextWrangler or Microsoft's Notepad are really not ideal. A much better option is a dedicated text editor intended for this purpose. My preferred editor is sublime, which is freely available in versions for windows, mac, and linux. Another option is to use a development environment like Anaconda's Spider, which incorporates a text editor."

    "\n",
    "1. Anything following a # mark is a comment, meaning that it is a description of what is going on in the program for human consumption. It will be ignored by the computer when the program is run. Commenting is VERY important in complex programs, because in the absence of comments it is almost impossible to figure out what the programmer was trying to do, which makes the code impossible to maintain or debug. This is true even if you are coming back to look at your own code. It's amazing how much you won't be able to follow your own logic a month or two later if you haven't commented.\n",
    "1. As in the ipython notebook, we needed to explicitly specify which libraries to import so that we could use numpy and matplotlib functions.\n",
    "1. At the end of the program, we used the savefig command to write the output to a file, since we're not going to be running this interactively. Matplotlib can save figures in a variety of formats, and is smart enough to figure out which one we want just from the file name extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've written this text into the text editor, we can save the file. Python programs are traditionally saved in files with the extension .py, so let's do that and save the file as sinplot.py. "
